## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the **TrackIt@NUS** user-guide!

Do you struggle having to use multiple apps to balance your school life? Do you waste precious time just trying
 to find the information you need in the many apps you use? Well, look no further. Our application, TrackIt@NUS is an
  all-in-one solution for a busy student like you to manage and organize your life, helping you to **Track Less, and
   Live More.**

TrackIt@NUS is a desktop app for managing modules, lessons, tasks, and contacts, tailored to the needs of NUS students and
  optimized for use via a [**Command Line Interface (CLI)**](#glossary) while still having the benefits of a
   [**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**](#glossary). If you can type fast, you will be able to manage your academic
    and social commitments much more efficiently than by using other traditional GUI apps.

What are you waiting for? Head on to [Section 2, **Quick Start**](#quick-start) to learn more!

## 3. About <a name="about"></a>

There are many things you can use TrackIt@NUS for. We have structured this document so it is easy for you to find
 what you need. In the [Common Symbols](#common-symbols), [Command Format](#command-format), and [Commands and their
  Purposes](#command-purpose) sections, you will find useful tips on reading this document. It is
  then followed by the [Features](#features) section, where the main features of TrackIt@NUS are documented.

### 3.1 Common Symbols <a name="common-symbols"></a>

| Symbol | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| :information_source: | This symbol indicates that something important to take note of. |
| :bulb: | This symbol indicates that a tip is being mentioned. |
| :warning: | This symbol indicates something to be careful of. |

### 3.2 Command Format <a name="command-format"></a>

Since **TrackIt@NUS** is a *CLI* application, knowing how to use commands is important. This following section shows you how to interpret and use commands in the app. All commands follow similar formats as outlined below and examples will be provided to help you understand their usage. Examples of commands and their formats will be written in `code-blocks`.

The table below explains some important technical terms. An example will be provided to help you visualize these terms.
| **Technical Term** | **Explanation** |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Command type | Depending on whether you are dealing with a Module, Task, Lesson or Contact, the type is `M`, `T`, `L` or `C` respectively. |
| Command word | The first word of the command. It determines the action the app should carry out. |
| Parameter | The word or group of words following the command word. They are values given to a command to perform the specified action. |
| Prefix | 	The word that at the start of a parameter. It distinguishes one parameter from another.|

<br>Example: `M add m/MODULE_CODE n/MODULE_NAME`<br>
<br>Breakdown:<br>
* **Command type** - `M`<br>
* **Command word** - `add`<br>
* **Parameters** - `MODULE_CODE` and `MODULE_NAME`<br>
* **Prefix** - `m/`, `n/`<br>

The following table explains how you can use a command with the provided format. More examples will be provided for each command in [Section 5, Features](#features). Words in the upper case are the parameters to be supplied by you.

| **Format** | **Meaning** | **Example** |
| ----- | -------- | -------------- |
| `lower_case/`<br><br>A lower case letter, followed by a forward slash | These are **prefixes**.<br><br>They are used to separate the different parameters of a command. | `n/`, `d/`, `t/`<br><br>Note that prefixes **cannot have spaces**: `n /` is **not** a prefix, and will not be recognized. |
| `UPPER_CASE`<br><br>Words in upper case | These are **parameters**.<br><br>They need to be supplied to complete certain commands | To create a new **contact** with the name **John**, we use the `add contact` command.<br><br>Suppose the `add contact` command looks like this: `C add n/NAME`<br><br>Simply replace `NAME` with `John` to create John's contact: `C add n/John` |
| `[UPPER_CASE]`<br><br>Words in upper case, surrounded by square brackets |  These are **optional parameters** and need not be included for some commands.| Suppose a command contains two parameters: `n/NAME [t/TAG]`<br><br>The **first parameter** `NAME` is **compulsory**.<br>The **second parameter** `TAG` is **optional**.<br><br>Since a `TAG` is optional, both of these commands are valid:<br><br><ul><li>`C add n/John`</li><li>`C add n/John t/Friend`</li></ul>|
| `UPPER_CASEâ€¦`<br><br>`[UPPER_CASE]...`<br><br>An ellipsis `...` following any words in upper case | These are parameters that can be used **multiple times** or **none at all**. | The following parameter can be used **multiple times**: `t/TAG...`<br><br>This means that it can be: <ul><li>**Left empty**</li><li>**Used one time**: `t/friend`</li><li>**Used multiple times: `t/friend t/groupmate`</li></ul> |

:information_source: Parameters can be in any order. e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
 

### 3.3 Duplicate Parameters <a name="duplicate-parameters"></a>
You can specify the same parameter more than once in a command. Depending on the command, you will receive different
 outcomes:
 
 | **Parameter** | **Explanation** | **Example** |
 | -------------| ---------------- | ----------- |
 |Could be used multiple times| **All occurrences** will be used when executing the command|In the `add contact`command, you can create a contact with **multiple tags.**<br><br>You can input multiple tags by chaining them:<br>`t/CS1101S t/TA`<br><br>This will give a contact these tags.|
 | Can only be used once | Only the **last occurrence** will be used when executing the command. | On executing `M add m/CS2103T n/Favourite Mod n/Software Engineering`, you will create a module with the name `Software Engineering`, and the name `SE` will be ignored. | 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. Layout <a name="layout"></a>

This section gives you a brief overview of the layout of TrackIt@NUS.

![Layout](images/Layout.png)
_Figure 2 - Layout of TrackIt@NUS_

TrackIt@NUS is divided into three main types of tabs:
* The **Upcoming** Tab
* The **Contacts** Tab
* The various **Module** Tabs

When you switch to a tab, the tab text will be highlighted in **blue**.

### Upcoming Tab <a name="upcomingtab"></a>
This is the main tab of the application, and is the default page when the app starts. It features a calendar view of the
 days for the next week, as well as the **Tasks** and **Lessons** you have added under the respective days they fall under. 

1. The first section labelled **"Overdue"** in red text, shows the Tasks that are past their deadline, and you have yet to complete. These **Tasks** will remain there until you delete them.

2. The second section is the weekly calendar view, with your **Lessons** and **Tasks** shown under each day.

3. The last section is labelled **Future**, and shows any **Tasks** that you may have added with a deadline falling after the date 7 days from today.

![UpcomingPanelUi](images/UpcomingPanelUi.png)
<br>_Figure 3 - Example of Upcoming Tab_

### Contacts Tab <a name="contactstab"></a>
The contacts tab shows you an overview of all the **contacts** you have within the app. 

![ContactsTab](images/ContactsTab.png)
<br>_Figure 4 - Example of Contacts Tab_

It will show you information for each contact such as:
* `NAME`: contact name

* `PHONE NUMBER`: contact's phone number

* `EMAIL`: contact's email

* `TAG`: any additional information you have about the contact, such as which module they are associated with (e.g. CS1010S), or their role (e.g. friend, TA)

### Module Tabs <a name="moduletabs"></a>
Here under each module's tab you can find all relevant **Lessons**, **Tasks** and **Contacts** that are related to the
 module. 
 
 ![ModuleTab](images/ModuleTab.png)
<br>_Figure 5 - Example of Module Tab_

Very convenient right? This information will be displayed in 3 sections:
 
1. `Lessons`: Here you can find the info for all weekly lessons, including its time and location so
 say goodbye to missing your classes!

2. `Tasks`: All the tasks for the module that you haven't done, listed in **chronological** order so that you know
 what to prioritize! Tips: Don't leave tutorials or assignments until the last day, chances are you not gonna finish it.

3. `Contacts`: Having difficulties with your assignment? Need TA's emails to ask? Look no further, this section
 will list all contacts that are tagged with this module code! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 5. Features <a name="features"></a>

This section contains all the information you need to know about the features of **TrackIt@NUS**. To use each feature or
 sub-feature, you will need to enter the command into the Command Box.

## 5.1 Module <a name="module"></a>
Module is the first thing you need to create when you start using the app, because each module will house its own lessons, tasks and related contacts. So, let's find out how to create a new module! 

### 5.1.1 Module Command Parameters
Here are the parameters used in the Module feature:
| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --------------| ----------------| ----------- |
| `MODULE_CODE`| Refers to the unique code given to the module.<br><br>You can personalise this and give it your own code. However, we recommend you use the moduleâ€™s official code. | **CS2103T** |
| `NAME`| Refers to the **Module** name. | **Software Engineering** |

### 5.1.2 Add

You can use this command to create a new Module (Or a new category of things to worry about).

Format: `M add m/MODULE_CODE n/NAME`

Example: To add the Module CS1231 Discrete Structures into TrackIt@NUS, follow these instructions.
| **Parameter** | |
| ------------|-|
| `MODULE_CODE` | CS1231 |
| `NAME` | Discrete Structures |

1. To add, type `M add m/CS1231S n/Discrete Structures` into the command box
2. Press `Enter` to execute.
3. The Result Display will show the success message and you will see your new module in the side panel.

![AddModuleOutcome](images/AddModuleOutcome.png)
<br>_Figure 6 - Example outcome of adding a module_

### 5.1.3 Edit
Because modules are displayed only on the side panel, it doesn't come with index. That's why to edit and delete a module, its
 code will be used! Let's see how to edit a module's name:

Format: `M edit m/MODULE_CODE n/NAME`

:information_source: Note:
* The `MODULE_CODE` provided must be present in the Module list.
* You are unable to edit a module's `MODULE_CODE`. In such a circumstance, please delete the module and create a new one with the correct module code.

Example: If you have spelt a module CS1231's name wrongly and wish to change it to the correct spelling `Programming Methodology`, follow these instructions.
1. Type `M edit m/CS1231S n/Programming Methodology` into the Command Box
2. Press `Enter` to execute
3. The Result Display will show a success message and you will be able to view the correct module name in the corresponding module tab.

(INSERT SCREENSHOT OF EDIT OUTCOME HERE)
<br>_Figure 7 - Example outcome of editing a module_

### 5.1.4 Delete
And what if you realized you accidentally added in a wrong module, or have finished one? Just delete that module! The
 command's syntax is as follows: 

Format: `M delete m/MODULE_CODE`

:information_source: Note: 
* When you delete a module, the contacts associated with that module will **not** be deleted. The tag will also **not** be edited in any way.
* When you delete a module, the app will delete all of its related tasks & lessons, so check twice before you delete it! 

To delete the module `CS2100`:
1. Type `M delete m/CS2100` into the Command Box
2. Press `Enter` to execute
3. The Result Display will show a success message and the module tab will be removed from the side panel.
