## Project: TrackIt@NUS

This portfolio aims to document the contributions that I have made to the **TrackIt@NUS** project. The Github Link to
 **TrackIt@NUS** can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp).
 
## 1. Overview
**TrackIt@NUS** is a desktop application to provide a simple an easy way for students to manage their academic and
 social life. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

## 2. Summary of Contributions
Together with Tiffany, we are in-charge of the UI/UX of the front-end development of TrackIt@NUS. 
Through the iterations, were have worked very closely with each other, as well as with the back-end team through the v1.2, v1.3 and v1.4 iterations.

### 2.1 Code Contributed

### 2.2 Design of App 
With a focus of a user-centric design, we wanted to create a UI that will not only fulfil the solution that
 addresses our target audience, but also a design that keeps users coming back. 
 We have drafted out various mock up designs for v1.2, v1.3 and v1.4 using Figma. 
 Our designs can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/4CJHXSfo1oevJtZrUQrzbK/CS2103T-W13-4-TrackIt-NUS?node-id=1%3A38)

### 2.3 UI Development
The main components for the **final** iteration includes a side panel, upcoming view, module view, contacts view and help view.
 I have done the side panel, module view and contact view while Tiffany did the Upcoming view and Help view. 
 We both contributed equally in terms of the styling of the UI. 
 
#### 2.3.1 Side Panel
I have added a side panel feature. This feature allow users to toggle between the different tabs easily. 
Initially, tabs elements were used in at the top of the views (.fxml) for initial v.1.2. 
This component was created to allow further degree of customization to fit the design mockups for the further
 iterations of TrackIt@NUS.

#### 2.3.2 Module View
I have added the module tab feature. 
This feature allow users to see their lessons, tasks and contacts related to a specific module in one view. 
This a necessary view for users to view the all the resources

#### 2.3.3 Contacts View
