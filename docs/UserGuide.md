## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>


Welcome to the **TrackIt@NUS** user-guide!

Do you struggle having to use multiple apps to balance your school life? Do you waste precious time just trying
 to find the information you need in the many apps you use? Well, look no further. Our application, **TrackIt@NUS** is an
  all-in-one solution for a busy student like you to manage and organize your life, helping you to *Track Less, and
   Live More.*

TrackIt@NUS is a desktop app for managing modules, lessons, tasks, and contacts, tailored to the needs of NUS students and
  optimized for use via a [**Command Line Interface (CLI)**](#glossary) while still having the benefits of a
   [**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**](#glossary). If you can type fast, you will be able to manage your academic
    and social commitments much more efficiently than by using other traditional GUI apps.

What are you waiting for? Head on to [Section 2, **Quick Start**](#quick-start) to learn more

## 2. Quick Start <a name="quick-start"></a>

1. Ensure you have **Java 11** or above on your Computer. You may install it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

1. Download the latest version of TrackIt@NUS from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for TrackIt@NUS.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. A GUI similar to Figure 1 shown below should appear in a few seconds. You

. Try typing `help` and pressing `Enter` to navigate to the Help Tab!<br>
 
For details on the commands you can use, please refer to [Section 5 - Features](#features).

## 3. About <a name="about"></a>

There are many things you can use TrackIt@NUS for. We have structured this document so it is easy for you to find
 what you need. In the [Common Symbols](#common-symbols), [Command Format](#command-format), and [Commands and their
  Purposes](#command-purpose) sections, you will find useful tips on reading this document. It is
  then followed by the [Features](#features) section, where the main features of TrackIt@NUS are documented.

### 3.1 Common Symbols <a name="common-symbols"></a>

| Symbol | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| :information_source: | This symbol indicates that something important to take note of. |
| :bulb: | This symbol indicates that a tip is being mentioned. |
| :warning: | This symbol indicates something to be careful of. |

### 3.2 Command Format <a name="command-format"></a>

Since **TrackIt@NUS** is a *CLI* application, knowing how to use commands is important. The following section shows you how to interpret and use commands in the app. All commands follow similar formats as outlined below and examples will be provided to help you understand their usage. Examples of commands and their formats will be written in `code-blocks`.

The table below explains some important technical terms. An example will be provided to help you visualize these terms.
| **Technical Term** | **Explanation** |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Command type | Depending on whether you are dealing with a Module, Task, Lesson or Contact, the type is `M`, `T`, `L` or `C` respectively. |
| Command word | The first word of the command. It determines the action the app should carry out. |
| Parameter | The word or group of words following the command word. They are values given to a command to perform the specified action. |
| Prefix | 	The word that at the start of a parameter. It distinguishes one parameter from another.|

<br>Example: `M add m/CODE n/MODULE_NAME`<br>
<br>Breakdown:<br>
* **Command type** - `M`<br>
* **Command word** - `add`<br>
* **Parameters** - `CODE` and `MODULE_NAME`<br>
* **Prefix** - `m/`, `n/`<br>

The following table explains how you can use a command with the provided format. More examples will be provided for each command in [Section 5, Features](#features). Words in the upper case are the parameters to be supplied by you.

| **Format** | **Meaning** | **Example** |
| ----- | -------- | -------------- |
| `lower_case/`<br><br>A lower case letter, followed by a forward slash | These are **prefixes**.<br><br>They are used to separate the different parameters of a command. | `n/`, `d/`, `t/`<br><br>Note that prefixes **cannot have spaces**: `n /` is **not** a prefix, and will not be recognized. |
| `UPPER_CASE`<br><br>Words in upper case | These are **parameters**.<br><br>They need to be supplied to complete certain commands | To create a new **contact** with the name **John**, we use the `add contact` command.<br><br>Suppose the `add contact` command looks like this: `C add n/NAME`<br><br>Simply replace `NAME` with `John` to create John's contact: `C add n/John` |
| `[UPPER_CASE]`<br><br>Words in upper case, surrounded by square brackets |  These are **optional parameters** and need not be included for some commands.| Suppose a command contains two parameters: `n/NAME [t/TAG]`<br><br>The **first parameter** `NAME` is **compulsory**.<br>The **second parameter** `TAG` is **optional**.<br><br>Since a `TAG` is optional, both of these commands are valid:<br><br><ul><li>`C add n/John`</li><li>`C add n/John t/Friend`</li></ul>|
| `UPPER_CASEâ€¦`<br><br>`[UPPER_CASE]...`<br><br>An ellipsis `...` following any words in upper case | These are parameters that can be used **multiple times** or **none at all**. | The following parameter can be used **multiple times**: `t/TAG...`<br><br>This means that it can be: <ul><li>**Left empty**</li><li>**Used one time**: `t/friend`</li><li>**Used multiple times: `t/friend t/groupmate`</li></ul> |

:information_source: Parameters can be in any order. e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
 

### 3.3 Duplicate Parameters <a name="duplicate-parameters"></a>
You can specify the same parameter more than once in each command. Depending on the command, you will receive different
 outcomes:
 
 | **Parameter** | **Explanation** | **Example** |
 | -------------| ---------------- | ----------- |
 |Could be used multiple times| **All occurrences** will be used when executing the command|In the `add contact`command, you can create a contact with **multiple tags.**<br><br>You can input multiple tags by chaining them:<br>`t/CS1101S t/TA`<br><br>This will give a contact these tags.|
 | Can only be used once | Only the **last occurrence** will be used when executing the command. | On executing `M add m/CS2103T n/Favourite Mod n/Software Engineering`, you will create a module with the name `Software Engineering`, and the name `SE` will be ignored. | 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. Application Layout <a name="layout"></a>

This section gives you a **brief overview** of the **layout** of TrackIt@NUS, and this will help you **get used** to our interface in **a matter of minutes**!

![Layout](images/UG/Layout.png)
_Figure 2 - Layout of TrackIt@NUS_

TrackIt@NUS is mainly divided into **four** carefully designed `tabs`:
* The `Upcoming tab` 
* The `Contacts tab`
* The various `Module tabs` 
* The `Help tab`

The `Side panel` on the left section allows you to **easily navigate** between the `tabs`. When you switch to a different `tab`, the new `tab` will be highlighted in **blue** in the `Side panel`. To run a command, simply type a command in the `Command box` and TrackIt@NUS will inform you about the outcome in the `Result display`.

### 4.1 Upcoming Tab <a name="upcomingtab"></a>
Built with a **clean UI**, the `Upcoming tab` is what you will see when you first run TrackIt@NUS! You get to see an **overview** of all your **upcoming lessons** for the week, as well as the **list of tasks that are due soon**. With the `Upcoming tab`, you don't have to worry about missing any lessons or deadlines anymore!

![UpcomingPanelUi](images/UG/UpcomingPanel.png)
_Figure 3 - Layout of Upcoming Tab_

In the `Upcoming tab`, there are **three** main `sections` arranged in **chronological order**:
1. The `Overdue section` is colored &#x1F534; to **warn** you about the **incomplete tasks** that are **past their deadline**. These tasks will remain there until you delete them, so remember to complete them as soon as possible!

2. The next seven `Daily sections` shows your daily **Lessons** and **Tasks** for the **next 7 days**. This is where you can start planning your schedule for the day.

3. The `Future section` shows the **Tasks** that are only due **at least 7 days later**, so these are tasks that you don't have to worry too much about for now.


### 4.2 Module Tabs <a name="moduletabs"></a>
Besides, the `Upcoming tab`, the `Module tab` is another **highlight** that you can look forward to! This is an **all-in-one page** with all the details that you will need when **studying for a specific module**. With this, you don't have to waste precious time toggling between your calendar, to-do list and contacts app anymore!
 
 ![ModuleTab](images/UG/ModulePanel.png)
 _Figure 4 - Layout of Module Tab_
 
The `Module tab` includes `Lessons`, `Tasks` and `Contacts` that are related to this module.
 
1. `Lessons`: List of **lessons** for this module.

2. `Tasks`: List of **tasks** in **chronological** order. 
  :bulb: *Don't leave tutorials or assignments until the last day, chances are you won't finish it on time!*

3. `Contacts`: List of **relevant contacts** for this module. Here's where you can **find help** if you have difficulties with your assignments!

:information_source: Click here to find out more about [Lessons](#lesson), [Tasks](#task) and [Contacts](#contact) .
   
 
### 4.3 Contacts Tab <a name="contactstab"></a>
So you might ask, why is there a need for the `Contacts tab` when I can add `contacts` in the `Module tab`? Well, the **beauty** of the `Contacts tab` is that you can add people who may **not be taking the same modules** as you but they are **still relevant** in your social life and/or school life! In this way, you can still include **other useful contacts** in TrackIt@NUS. How cool is that?

:information_source: Relevant contacts can include your course mates, hostel friends, or even just school mates!

![ContactsTab](images/UG/ContactsPanel.png)
_Figure 5 - Layout of Contacts Tab_

:information_source: Click here to find out more about [Contacts](#contact) .
 
### 4.4 Help Tab <a name="helptab"></a>
Feeling **lost**? If you are **lazy** to spend time looking through this long and detailed user guide to find **a single command**, here's an extra bonus for you! This `Help tab` gives you a **quick summary** of the commands that you can use. This way, you can fire multiple commands in **a matter of seconds** and you can be one step closer to **productivity**! 
 
![HelpTab](images/UG/HelpPanel.png)

## 5. Features <a name="features"></a>

This section contains all the information you need to know about the features of **TrackIt@NUS**. To use each feature or
 sub-feature, you will need to enter the command into the Command Box.

## 5.1 Module <a name="module"></a>
Module is the first thing you need to create when you start using the app, because each module will house its own lessons, tasks and related contacts. So, let's find out how to create a new module! 

### 5.1.1 Module Command Parameters <a name="module-command-parameter"></a>
Here are the parameters used in the Module feature:
| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --------------| ----------------| ----------- |

_Figure 7 - Example outcome of adding a module_

### 5.1.3 Edit a Module `M edit` <a name="module-edit"></a>
Because modules are displayed only on the side panel, they are not indexed. That's why to edit and delete a module, its code will be used instead! This is how to edit a module's code and/or name:

Format: `M edit CODE [m/NEW_CODE] [n/NAME]`

:information_source: The `CODE` provided must be present in the `Module` list.

Example: If you have spelled a module CS1231S's code wrongly and wish to change it to the correct code `CS1231`, follow these instructions.

| **Parameter** | **Example** |
| ------------|-|
| `CODE` | `CS1231S` |
| `NEW_CODE` | `CS1231` |

1. Type `M edit CS1231S m/CS1231` into the Command Box.
2. Press `Enter` to execute.
3. The Result Display will show a success message and you will be able to view the correct module name in the corresponding module tab.

![EditModuleOutcome](images/UG/EditModuleOutcome.png)
_Figure 8 - Example outcome of editing a module_

### 5.1.4 Delete a Module `M delete` <a name="module-delete"></a>
And what if you realized you accidentally added in a wrong module, or have finished one? Just delete that module! The
 command's syntax is as follows: 

Format: `M delete CODE`


:warning: all related `tasks` & `lessons` will be deleted as well, so check twice before you delete it! 
:information_source:  `contacts` associated with that module will **not** be deleted. The `tag` will **not** be removed as well.

To delete the module `CS1231`:

| **Parameter** | **Example** |
| ------------|-|
| `CODE` | `CS1231` |

1. Type `M delete CS1231` into the Command Box
2. Press `Enter` to execute
3. The Result Display will show a success message and the module tab will be removed from the side panel.

## 5.4 Contact <a name="contact"></a>
Don't you hate it when you need help for one of your modules but you just can't remember who else is taking the module with you? 

Luckily for you, TrackIt@NUS allows you to tag your contacts with the modules you have in common, and lets you see those contacts all at once! Simply click on a [module tab](#moduletabs) and you will find the list of contacts associated with that module.

To view all contacts from all modules, as well as any contacts that are not associated with any module, click on the [**Contacts** tab](#contactstab) in the side panel.

### 5.4.1 Contact Command Parameters <a name="contact-command-parameters"></a>
Here are the parameters used in the Contact feature:
| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --------------| ----------------| ----------- |
| `INDEX` | Indicates the position of an item in a list. The specified `INDEX` must be **within the range** of the number of items in the list. | `1` - refers to the first item in a list |
| `NAME`| Refers to the **Contact** name. | `John Doe` |
| `[PHONE_NUMBER]` | (Optional) Refers to the phone number of a contact. Phone numbers must consist of only numbers, and can be of any length. | `999` |

### 5.4.3 Edit a Contact `C edit` <a name="contact-edit"></a>

* The parameters `n/NAME`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `e/EMAIL` and `t/TAG` are optional;
however, at least one parameter must be provided (i.e. `C edit 1` is not a valid command).

* All tags can be removed by typing `t/`

## 6. FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

**Q: Will my data be saved in the computer?** <br>
A: TrackIt@NUS data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?** <br>
A: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TrackIt@NUS home folder.

**Q: How many `modules` can I add in total?** <br>
A: The current limit is 10 modules.

**Q: The pandemic is not over and my `lessons` are still online. Can I include Zoom links in my `lessons` address field ?** <br>
A: Unfortunately, as of v1.4, the `ADDRESS` field supports up to **20 char**. Clickable Zoom links may be added in subsequent versions.

**Q: Can I add a biweekly `lesson` in the module?** <br>
A: Unfortunately, as of v1.4, only weekly lessons are supported. Biweekly and monthly lessons may be added in subsequent versions.

**Q: Why can I add a `lesson` that clashes with my existing `lessons`? Is this a bug?** <br>
A: This is because there are instances where students are granted **a case-by-case approval** to overload modules with **concurrent lessons**. These students should have the option to include concurrent lessons. 
 
**Q: Why is there a need for the `Contacts Tab` when I can already add `contacts` in the `Module Tab`?** <br>
A: It is meant for you to add `contacts` that **may not be taking** the same modules as you but they are **still relevant** in your social life and/or studies. Please refer to the [Contacts Tab](#contactstab) for more details.
