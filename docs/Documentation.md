# TrackIt@NUS Documentation

## Introduction

We use Markdown for documentation purposes because it provides ease of writing and formatting.

## Setup and Maintenance

* We use [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) to manage documentation.
* The `docs/` folder is used for documentation.
* To learn how set it up and maintain the project website, follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] **Using Jekyll for project documentation**_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jekyll.html).


## Markdown Guidance

* Follow the [**_Google developer documentation style guide_**](https://developers.google.com/style).

* Also relevant is the [_[se-edu/guides] **Markdown coding standard**_](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/markdown.html)

## Editing Diagrams

* See the [_[se-edu/guides] **Using PlantUML**_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html)

## Converting Documentation to PDF format
