## Project: TrackIt@NUS

This portfolio aims to document the contributions that I have made to the **TrackIt@NUS** project. The Github Link to
 **TrackIt@NUS** can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp).
 
## 1. Overview
**TrackIt@NUS** is a desktop application to provide a simple an easy way for students to manage their academic and
 social life. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

## 2. Summary of Contributions
Together with Tiffany, we are in-charge of the **UI/UX** of the **front-end development** of TrackIt@NUS. 
Through the iterations, were have worked very closely with each other, as well as with the back-end team through the v1.2, v1.3 and v1.4 iterations.

### 2.2 Design of App 
With a focus of a user-centric design, we wanted to create a UI that will not only fulfil the solution that
 addresses our target audience, but also a design that keeps users coming back. 
 We have drafted out various mock up designs for v1.2, v1.3 and v1.4 using Figma. 
 Our designs can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/4CJHXSfo1oevJtZrUQrzbK/CS2103T-W13-4-TrackIt-NUS?node-id=1%3A38)

### 2.3 UI Development
The main components for the **final** iteration includes a side panel, upcoming view, module view, contacts view and help view.
 I have done the side panel, module view and contact view while Tiffany did the Upcoming view and Help view. 
 We both contributed equally in terms of the styling of the UI. 
 
#### 2.3.1 Side Panel
I have added a side panel feature. This feature allow users to toggle between the different tabs easily. 
Initially, tabs elements were used in at the top of the views (.fxml) for initial v.1.2.
However, the design of the tabs vertically does not give users a good experience. 
After considerations and further discussion with the backend team, we decided to include this for further degree of customisations of the app.
This component is necessary because users need a section in the app to toggle between the upcoming view, the module view, the contact view and the help view.

#### 2.3.2 Module View
I have added the module tab feature. 
This feature is one of the core features, and it allow users to see their lessons, tasks and contacts related to a specific module in one view. 
This a necessary view for users to view the all their school related stuff for a specific module in a specific way. 
Within the Module View, there is TaskPanel, LessonPanel and ContactPanel, all of which are adapted and extended from those in AB3.

#### 2.3.3 Contacts View
I have added the contact tab feature.
This feature is necessary, and is not to be confused with the contact panel in the module tab.
This feature is necessary for users to include contacts that are not taking the same modules, but still relevant to user's school work. More info can be found in the user guide. Similar to the module view, it contains a ContactPanel which is adapted and extended from those in AB3.

### 2.4 Project Management
Participated actively and discussed critically on the core functionality, as well as the directions for the team for both v1.3 and v1.4.
Facilitates the progress of Front-end team and request the necessary methods and implementations from the back-end.
Manages the PRs for the front-end team before merging to master, in which PR will be further reviewed by back-end team.
