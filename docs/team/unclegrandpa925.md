# Vuong Hoang Long - Project Portfolio

## PROJECT: TrackIt@NUS

This portfolio aims to document the contributions that I have made to the **TrackIt@NUS** project. The Github Link to
 **TrackIt@NUS** can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp).
 
## Overview

**TrackIt@NUS** is a desktop application to provide a simple an easy way for students to manage their academic and
 social life. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

## General contributions
* Author of the original idea of the project. Defended the idea before teammates so that it became the final project direction.

## Code contributions

The code I contributed can be found [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=unclegrandpa925)

**The code design decision I made can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#code-des-cons)**

## Feature, UI/UX contributions
* Designed most of the business logic of the app, including: 
    * What fields a Module / Contact/ Lesson / Task have, and their restrictions
    * How the 4 classes link together
    * The tab structure of the app (how each module has its own tab + Upcoming tab + Contacts Tab)
    * The syntax & business logic of all commands
    * An index system to edit/delete Contact, Lesson and Task
    * No index for Module, instead Editing/Deleting is done by its code
* Designed the layout of the Upcoming tab and each Module tab. A great amount of effort (including extensively study from 5 different todo apps: macOS's reminders, Microsoft To Do, Todoist, OmniFocus) has been put into each layout to make sure it's intuitive & convenient for users
* Contributed the idea of having color codes for each module 
* Gathered comments of peers to guarantee that the UI/UX suits a wide-range of users
* More about the rationale behind my design consideration can be read [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#38-feature-design-considerations-)

## Teamwork contributions
Led the team for the entire project. Contributions to team includes:
* Divided tasks between members and covered up for a member if they are busy 
* Made sure the project progress followed the timeline
* Facilitated weekly meetings between team members
* Consolidated members' opinions in debate to make final decision about features / UI&UX design
* Connected the front-end team and the back-end team by listening to the front-end team's back-end request and adapt the back-end accordingly.
* Oversee the integration process of the front-end into the back-end
* Oversee the entire back-end development (the entire back-end structure was designed by myself & Simon)

## Testing contributions
Led both the writing of automated testing and the effort of manual testing. Personally I have spent 5-6 hours to test the app manually.

## User Guide contributions
My write up in the UG can be found here:
* [Module Manager section](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md#module)

## Bugs fixer
Doing the development process, when a bug is located, most of the time I'm the one who quickly located the bug and fixed it.

## Developer Guide contributions
My write up in the DG can be found here:
* All section of [Design](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#design) except UI component
* [Module Manager](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#module-manager)
